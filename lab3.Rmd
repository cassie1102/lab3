## Logistic Regression in R

The lab material is based on [Chapter 4 Lab from ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Chapter%204%20Lab.txt). Let's first lok at the Stock Market data. Please go to the help documents of ISLR and read the descriptions of the 9 variables of `Smarket`.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket)
```

Some EDA.
```{r ggpairs, cache = TRUE}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(Smarket)
```

Let's look at the correlations between these variables. Note the `cor` only works on numeric variables.
```{r}
try(cor(Smarket))[1]
cor(Smarket[,-9])
```

```{r}
attach(Smarket)
plot(Volume)
```

Let's fit a logistic regression model to predict `Direction`. We start by using the `Lag1` to `Lag5` and `Volume`.
```{r}
glm.fits=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Smarket,family=binomial)
summary(glm.fits)
coef(glm.fits)
summary(glm.fits)$coef
summary(glm.fits)$coef[,4] # closer look at the p-values
```

How well does the model fits the data?
```{r}
glm.probs=predict(glm.fits,type="response")
glm.probs[1:10]
glm.pred=rep("Down",1250)
glm.pred[glm.probs>.5]="Up"
table(glm.pred,Direction)
(507+145)/1250
mean(glm.pred==Direction)
```

Split the dataset into training set and testing set and see how well is the out-of-sample classification. The classification error in the testing set is 0.52, which is above 0.5. This means that the out-of-sample prediction is terrible.
```{r}
train=(Year<2005) # training set
Smarket.2005=Smarket[!train,] # testing set
dim(Smarket.2005)
Direction.2005=Direction[!train]
glm.fits=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Smarket,family=binomial,subset=train)
glm.probs=predict(glm.fits,Smarket.2005,type="response")
glm.pred=rep("Down",252)
glm.pred[glm.probs>.5]="Up"
table(glm.pred,Direction.2005)
mean(glm.pred==Direction.2005)
mean(glm.pred!=Direction.2005)
```

Maybe simplifying the model will help. Try fitting the model with only `Lag1` and `Lag2` on the training set, and then print a contingency table of observations vs. predictions. What is the classification error?
